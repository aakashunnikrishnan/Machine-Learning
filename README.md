# Machine-learning

This is a GitHub repository where I have stored the materials that I used to practice and learn machine learning.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task by analyzing and using patterns in data. The materials in this repository include code, datasets, and other resources that I found useful in learning various machine learning concepts and techniques.
